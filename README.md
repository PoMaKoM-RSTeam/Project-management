## Demo

## Tech Stack

**Client:** Angular, SCSS, TypeScript

**Server:** Next.js, PostgreSQL

## Features

A short list of additional features implemented in our project:

- Light/dark mode
- Drag and drop
- Fullscreen mode
- Cross platform

## Installation

### Clone the repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/PoMaKoM-RSTeam/Project-management.git
cd rsschool-angular
```

### Install npm packages

Install the `npm` packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

The `npm start` command builds (compiles TypeScript and copies assets) the application into `dist/`, watches for changes to the source files, and runs `server` on port `4200`.

Shut it down manually with `Ctrl-C`.

#### npm scripts

These are the most useful commands defined in `package.json`:

- `npm start` - runs the TypeScript compiler, asset copier, and a server at the same time, all three in "watch mode".
- `npm run build` - runs the TypeScript compiler and asset copier once.
- `npm run build:watch` - runs the TypeScript compiler and asset copier in "watch mode"; when changes occur to source files, they will be recompiled or copied into `dist/`.
- `npm run lint` - runs `eslint` on the project files.
- `npm run serve` - runs `server`.

These are the test-related scripts:

- `npm test` - builds the application and runs Intern tests (both unit and functional) one time.
- `npm run ci` - cleans, lints, and builds the application and runs Intern tests (both unit and functional) one time.
